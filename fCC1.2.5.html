      <h1 id="title">Harm Reduction: Amanita Muscaria</h1>
      <p>One of the most recognizable mushrooms, and a less restricted choice for people seeking an experience similar to that of P. Cubensis (the tradtional "magic mushroom"). In some places, laws are not as restrictive on Amanita Muscaria, meaning that it is able to be purchased online and shipped. If you choose to partake in substance abuse (the use of a substance, in the attempt to cause inebriation), it is your resposibility to understand the potential risks.</p>

          Amanita Muscaria, "Fly Agaric", is found from Southern Alaska down through the Rocky Moutains, through Central America, all the way to Andean Colombia. Considered common and abundant in regions where it grows, fruiting bodies begin their cycle looking similar to an egg, shortly after pinning the cap begins forming small, white-yellow warts (remnants of the universal veil, the membrane that covers the mushroom when it is very young). As the fungus grows it begins taking on it's red color as the cap expands with growth, the previously formed universal veil breaks as it expands, leaving fragments that do not change size but are spread apart. Although very distinct, there are many look-alikes that can be potentially lethal if consumed.

        <h3>Timeline-History of the Amanita Muscaria</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1256</strong>
            -- Albertus Magnus is believed to be first to record A. Muscaria in his work De vegetabilious calling the it the fly mushroom. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1753</strong>
            -- Carl Linnaeus described the species in volume 2 of his Species Plantarum, giving it the name Agaricus Muscarius.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1783</strong>
            -- A. Muscaria gained its current name when placed in the genus Amanita by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1784</strong>
            -- First suggestion of the notion that Vikings used A. Muscaria to produce their "berserker rage", suggested by Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1821</strong>
            -- The name "Amanita Muscaria" is sanctioned by Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1823</strong>
            -- German physician Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the first published account on how to detoxify the mushroom.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1869</strong>
            -- Muscarine is first isolated from A. Muscaria by German chemists Oswald Schmiedeberg and Richard Koppe at the University of Tartu.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1964</strong>
            -- Muscimol is first isolated from <strong>A. Pantherina</strong> by Japanese chemist Shohei Onda, published in the journal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin in <strong>1965</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2006</strong>
            -- A molecular phylogenetic study of different populations of A. Muscaria by József Geml finds 3 distinct "clades" within the species, roughly representing: <strong>Eurasian, Eurasian "subalpine", and North American</strong>. All three clades have been found in Alaska, leading to the hypothesis that this is the center of diversification for this species. This study also found that 4 distinct varieties of the species are found within 2 of the clades, providing evidence that the varieties are polymorphisms rather than distinct subspecies. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008</strong>
            -- Again József Geml conducts molecular study on A. Muscaria and finds that the original 3 genetic groups (<strong>Eurasian, Eurasian "Subalpine", and North American</strong>), a 4th associated with oak/hickory/pine forests in Southeastern United States, a 5th and 6th found on Santa Cruz Island, California, are <strong>all</strong> delineated enough from each other to be considered seperate species.

             "It turns out that muscarine is only a minor chemical component of the fly agaric, perhaps 1-3% by weight. Schmiedeberg and Kloppe had been very fortunate to isolate this alkaloid with its marked parasympathetic effect. The other active alkaloids in A. muscaria were not isolated until the 1960s; they are ibotenic acid, muscazole and muscazone"
