            The Puffco Peak is an electronic "dab" rig (e-rig) that is designed to provide a smooth and flavorful vaping experience, in contrast to traditional combustion methods. It uses a combination of water filtration and precision heating to vaporize concentrates at the ideal temperature.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <p>The Peak features a number of features that make it a popular choice for dabbers. These features include:</p>
            <li>Precision heating</li>
            <li>Water filtration</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Durable construction</li>

          <p>This short instruction set will guide you on how to use the Puffco Peak:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Charge your Peak</li>
            <li>Fill the water bubbler</li>
            <li>Load the Peak: To load the Peak, simply remove the chamber cap and place a small amount of concentrate into the chamber. Be careful not to load more than ~0.3g to avoid overflow</li>
            <li>Turn on Peak: simply press and hold the activation button for 3 seconds. The Peak will vibrate and the light will turn white.</li>
            <li>Select temperature setting: The Peak has 4 temp setting, Blue (450), Green (500), Red (550) and White (600). To select a temp, press the same "activation" button once and let the color light up, then press a second time to switch to the next color</li>
            <li>Heat: To start the heating cycle, press the activation button once to wake up the Peak, then while the light is still on, double press the activation button. The Peak will vibrate twice in response, and the light should pulse from bright to dim as it heats up. The Peak will vibrate 3 times to let you know it is ready for inhalation</li>
          </ol>

            After each use, it is important to clean the Peak to remove any residual concentrate and to keep it functioning properly. To clean the Peak, simply remove the chamber cap and swab the inside of the ceramic bowl and surrounding chamber with a Q-Tip (the Peak must still be warm, otherwise use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to help get stuck on residue off).
